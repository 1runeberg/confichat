# Contributing to ConfiChat

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **ConfiChat**! We welcome contributions from everyone and are excited to see what you bring to the project. Below are the guidelines for contributing to this Flutter application.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Start by forking the ConfiChat repository on GitHub. This creates your own copy of the project where you can make changes.

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ConfiChat.git
   cd ConfiChat
   ```

3. **Set Upstream Remote**
   - Set the original repository as the upstream remote to easily sync changes.
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/ConfiChat.git
   ```

4. **Create a New Branch**
   - Always create a new branch for your work to keep your changes organized and separate from the main codebase.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch
   ```

## Best Practices

- **Follow Flutter Best Practices**: Ensure your code follows Flutter's [best practices](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout/best-practices).
- **Prioritize Privacy and Security**:
  - **Data Encryption**: Ensure that you maintain features on sensitive data, such as chat histories, is encrypted and stored locally.
  - **Secure API Calls**: Use HTTPS for all online API calls and handle API keys securely, avoiding hardcoding them in the codebase. Check out the LlmApi class.
  - **Minimal Data Retention**: Retain only the necessary data and implement clear data deletion mechanisms.
  - **User Permissions**: Request only the necessary permissions from users, and ensure these permissions are handled securely.
  - **Sensitive Data Handling**: Avoid logging sensitive information such as API keys, user credentials, or private conversations.
- **Focus on Memory and Resource Efficiency**: 
  - Use lazy initialization to avoid unnecessary memory usage.
  - Dispose of controllers and listeners properly to free up resources.
  - Prefer `const` constructors where possible to reduce widget rebuilds.
  - Avoid unnecessary object creation inside loops or frequently called methods.
  - Use efficient data structures like `List` or `Set` instead of less efficient ones.
- **Write Clear and Descriptive Commit Messages**: Provide clear and concise commit messages to describe your changes.
- **Keep Commits Small and Focused**: Break down large changes into smaller, focused commits for easier review.
- **Test Your Changes**: Make sure your changes donâ€™t break any existing functionality. Write tests if applicable.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push Your Changes**
   - Once youâ€™re happy with your changes, push your branch to your forked repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to the original ConfiChat repository on GitHub and create a pull request from your branch. Describe your changes in detail and mention any related issues.

3. **CI Checks**
   - GitHub CI is enabled to automatically check pull requests. This includes tests and linting to ensure code quality. Please review any feedback from CI and make necessary adjustments.

4. **Code Review**
   - Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be open to feedback and make any requested changes.

5. **Merge**
   - Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the main codebase.

## Keeping Your Fork Updated

To keep your fork up to date with the latest changes from the original repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```
